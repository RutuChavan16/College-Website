<p>With the Vision of “Locally Rooted, Globally Competent Education”, 
N. K. Orchid College of Engineering & Technology, Solapur (NKOCET) 
started from the academic year 2008-09. NKOCET is approved by AICTE, 
New Delhi, recognized by Government of Maharashtra with its SE, TE, BE and ME 
classes are affiliated to Solapur University.
 From this academic year 2017-18 first year of the UG course is affiliated
 to the newly formed state technological university of Maharashtra; 
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Lonere. 
The NKOCET has spread over picturesque, sprawling land of 10.6 acres
 in the vicinity of Hipparga Lake in Tale-Hipparaga, Solapur.
 It has emerged as a preferred knowledge destination for aspiring Engineering students.
 NKOCET provides excellent engineering education and creates
 globally competent technocrats. The trust, Pradnya Niketan Education Society,
 Pune has been founded by 14 highly educated eminent Technocrats, Bureaucrats
 and Entrepreneurs who have envisioned transformation of society 
through education and to serve for welfare of the people.</p>

NKOCET has added many feathers in its cap through its journey. 
In recognition of its academic excellence, the institute was conferred 36th rank in 
“Top 50 Private Engineering Colleges in India” in 2012 by Bhaskar-Lakshya Magazine. 
NKOCET is known for its strong teaching-learning process where lot of precedence 
is given on practical and real knowledge acquisition.</p> 


<p>The Institute has been a leader in academics with effective teaching-learning 
pedagogy which has produced many University Rankers. 
The institute is renowned for its academic excellence as every year
 almost 50 percent university rankers are from NKOCET. 
The institute has not only made its mark in the affiliated university
 through excellent academic results but also left its footprints in the 
top-notch MNCs by placing Competent Engineers.</p>

<p>Considering varied backgrounds and different learning abilities,
 lot of emphasis is given on strengthening theoretical as well as practical
 knowledge by providing student-centric teaching learning pedagogies.
 With the effective use of ICT, the teaching learning process has been 
transformed, wherein students are made to learn through NPTEL 
MOOCs courses, spoken tutorials, video recorded faculty lectures, 
animations, simulation software. </p>


<p>The well-organized Library consist leading National and International
 periodicals and Research Journals along with a huge collection of books 
which is accessible 24x7 for the students.

 To establish strong industry-connect, the institute has signed MoUs with
 industries for training the students on advanced technologies and mentoring
 for final year projects. 
 The institute  also encourages the student’s innovation and creativity
 by arranging technical competitions and national level 
events like Orchitech every year. 


<p>The Institute has initiated a novel concept of Soft Skills for future
 engineers for their personal and professional advancements.
 The Soft Skills Training conducted by NKOCET focuses on elements of Training &
 Development that require changes in Communication, behavior, adaptability &

 <h2><b>About Department:</b></h2>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is continuous accelerated growing demand
of electricity in our country due to growing industrialization
and changing life style of our people. Therefore presently 
and in near future there are plenty of opportunities available
for placement in various sector/ organization to electrical engineers.
A quite large expansion of power sector is currently taking place.
And in near future also the same is planned in phased manner by 
our government in state & at centre.


There is tremendous scope in the field of Planning, design, 
construction/erection of power plants (stations),Electricity
transmission system, Power distribution system their testing,
commissioning, operation & maintenance & trouble attending, 
ritro fitting etc.
<br>




 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost all types of industries (other than electrical)
 medium, large size invariably & even small size also there 
is scope for placement to electrical engineers. 
Because every industry manufacturing & process require electricpower
supply for running electric machines (motors) ,transformer 
for lighting, water pump, street light etc. 
So depending on size of industry, there are placement opportunities 
to electrical engineers ranging from one for small size to
 hundreds & above for large size.
